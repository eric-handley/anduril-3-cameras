# 1. Project Description and Scope

## Background / Context

Uvic Rocketry currently has no way of acquiring visual flight data. Visual footage of systems like recovery activation, parachute deployment etc would be extremely useful in providing insight for future designs. The scope of the Camera system is to design a suite of cameras to monitor numerous locations of the rocket. These locations will consist of:

1. Outside the rocket pointing down towards the motor
2. Inside the fuselage looking towards the horizon
3. Outside the rocket looking up towards the nosecone
4. Inside the recovery bay looking up

**Note:** Mounting will not be part of this system's scope.

## Design Specifications

The camera system design must address the following elements:

- **Camera selection**: Must record at suitable fps and resolution for footage to be useful
- **Footage storage**: The system will be responsible for storing its own footage
- **Integration**: The system must integrate with the lower avionics bay team, power supply team, and flight computer team. Requirements for this system must be clearly communicated with these teams
- **Wiring Harness(s)**: A wiring harness must be designed that suits the needs of your system
- **Cost & Mass**: Provide a cost and mass estimate for your selected design
- **Optional**: An STM32 based software driver for your selected camera system

## Evaluation Criteria

Concepts should be evaluated on:

- **Camera performance** (fps, resolution)
- **Total Storage Space**
- **Size and Mass Efficiency**
- **Ease of Integration**
